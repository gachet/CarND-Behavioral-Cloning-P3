# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-Project

Files included in the project:

- **model.py**: The script used to create and train the model.
- **drive.py**: The script to drive the car. You can feel free to resubmit the original drive.py or make modifications and submit your modified version.
- **model.h5**: The saved model. Here is the [documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) explaining how to create this file.
- **writeup_report.md**: writeup_report as a markdown or pdf file. It should explain the structure of your network and training approach. While we recommend using English for good practice, writing in any language is acceptable (reviewers will translate). There is no minimum word count so long as there are complete descriptions of the problems and the strategies. See the rubric and the writeup_template.md for more details about the expectations.

Note: There will be some .ipynb files too that are used for exploratory analysis or to ease the scripts writing.
